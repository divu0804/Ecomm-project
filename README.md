## Project Name: Book Recommendation System

### Introduction:
This project is a collaborative effort to build a book recommendation system using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid techniques. The system leverages data from multiple sources, including books, ratings, book tags, and tags, to provide personalized book recommendations to users.

### Data Sources:
- `books.csv.zip`: Contains information about books such as book ID, title, authors, average rating, and other relevant attributes.
- `ratings.csv.zip`: Includes user ratings for various books, with details like user ID, book ID, and the corresponding rating.
- `book_tags.csv.zip`: Provides tags associated with each book, linking books to specific genres or themes.
- `tags.csv`: Contains a comprehensive list of tags used in the book tagging system.

### Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

### How to Execute:
1. Download the project files from the repository.
2. Extract the contents of the zip files (`books.csv.zip`, `ratings.csv.zip`, `book_tags.csv.zip`) to the project directory.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook environment.
4. Navigate to the project directory in Jupyter Notebook.
5. Open the following notebooks in order:
   - `Baseline.ipynb`: Initial data loading and preprocessing.
   - `Data_analysis_and_exploration.ipynb`: Explore the data to gain insights and understand patterns.
   - `Collaborative_filtering.ipynb`: Implement collaborative filtering algorithms for recommendation.
   - `Content_based.ipynb`: Build content-based filtering models for recommendation.
   - `Hybrid_recommender.ipynb`: Combine collaborative and content-based approaches to create a hybrid recommendation system.
6. Execute each cell in the notebooks sequentially to run the code and generate results.
7. Follow the instructions within the notebooks for specific tasks such as model training, evaluation, and generating recommendations.

### Additional Notes:
- Make sure to have all necessary libraries and dependencies installed before running the code.
- You may need to adjust file paths or configurations based on your local environment.
